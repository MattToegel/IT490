<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Mention the Vendors you explored and some pros/cons for each that affected your decision</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I have explored the following vendors:<div>Amazon</div><div>Azure</div><div>Google</div><div>The pros and cons of the vendors are<br>as follows:</div><div>Scalability:</div><div>A virtual computer on Amazon EC2 may be auto-scaled and resized. The<br>auto-scaling task entails maintaining a specified number of instances and initiating and stopping<br>them on demand. Amazon Auto-scaling is also beneficial since it can keep VMs<br>healthy and restart them as necessary.</div><div>Availability groups, in which VMs may be added,<br>are how Microsoft Azure&#39;s auto-scaling services work. Then we may specify the number<br>of instances to scale up and down, as well as the CPU workload<br>and queue size requirements.</div><div>Horizontal auto-scaling is provided by Google CE by adding or<br>deleting new instances in a controlled group of VMs. They&#39;re both made using<br>the same template.</div><div><br></div><div>Availability:</div><div><div>If a VM was offline for more than 0.5% of the<br>month, the Amazon EC2 Service Level Agreement offers a 10% discount. If we<br>couldn&#39;t use the machine for more than 1% of the month, we&#39;ll get<br>a 30% credit. One minute is the smallest amount of downtime that was<br>recorded.</div><div>The Microsoft Azure Service Level Agreement (SLA) is identical to Amazon&#39;s, with the<br>exception of the maximum credit limit, which is set at just 25%.</div><div>If an<br>instance is down for more than 5 minutes in a row, Google CE<br>SLA will give you a credit of 25% discount</div></div><div><br></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Which vendor option did you go with and why?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I chose Amazon EC2 because it is efficient in terms of scalability and<br>availability. Moreover it also provides personal IP address configuration option so that the<br>security can be enhanced for the virtual machine.<div><br></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> How do you plan to manage your usage quota? (Also mention the quota)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Free usage quota:<div>30 GB of EBS storage, 2 million IOs, 1 GB of<br>snapshots, and<br>100 GB of bandwidth to the internet.</div><div>Quota management:</div><div>I have used the quota<br>to create various instances on Amazon EC2 which includes Ubuntu and Amazon Linux<br>instance. Also I will power off the VM when I am not using<br>it to save quota usage.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>

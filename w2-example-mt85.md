<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Mention the Vendors you explored and some pros/cons for each that affected your decision</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I looked into Google, Microsoft, and Amazon&#39;s offerings for VM instances.&nbsp; Google offers<br>and always free tier, but its not clear whether it has all the<br>features we require for control of the instance.&nbsp; Microsoft&#39;s Azure offers a free<br>for 12 months tier which gives access to over 40 other features and<br>services and meets the permissions requirements.&nbsp; Their quota is 750 hours per month<br>overall.&nbsp; Amazon&#39;s AWS has a free tier and a free for 12 months<br>offering which gives access to over 60 other services and features in AWS<br>and meets all of our permissions requirements.&nbsp; Their quota is 750 hours per<br>month overall for the 12 month free offering.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Which vendor option did you go with and why?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I went with Amazon&#39;s AWS because it meets all of the requirements and<br>has the most features and membership options for free users available compared to<br>Azure and Google&#39;s offerings for VMs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> How do you plan to manage your usage quota? (Also mention the quota)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The VM will be turned off when not in use.&nbsp; Additional VM creation<br>will be kept to a minimum to not exceed the overall hourly quota<br>for a membership.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
